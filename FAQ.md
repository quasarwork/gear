## Can I contribute to this project?

I originally created this project for my own use. Hence, I do not accept any contributions yet. I am unsure if I will accept any contributions in the future. Though, if you have a suggestion, feel free to open an issue or a discussion.

## Is there a Javascript version of this project?

This project relies mainly on [Effect] which is a [TypeScript] framework. Hence, I do not plan to create a Javascript version of this project.
